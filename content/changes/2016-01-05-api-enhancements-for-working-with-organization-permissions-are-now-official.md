To allow API developers to take advantage of the [improved organization permissions][dotcom-blog-post] that launched in September 2015, we're making the [API enhancements][api-enhancements-blog-post] for working with organization permissions a part of the official GitHub API.

During the preview period, you needed to [provide a custom media type in the `Accept` header][preview-period] to opt-in to the changes. Now that the preview period has ended, you no longer need to specify this custom [media type][custom-media-types].

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch with us][contact]!
